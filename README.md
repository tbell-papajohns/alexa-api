Once you have changes, you should *push* them to your *fork* on GitHub and [create a Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/) for review. Be sure to choose the appropriate destination branch for this repository. Often this will be a *release* or *feature* branch.

    git remote add upstream https://github.com/papajohns-ds/alexa-skill-handler-service.git

Whenever your *local* repository grows behind, you can run `git fetch upstream` to gather information about the new changes or branches in this repository. This way, when you are ready to start new work, you can run the following commands to ensure your *local* branch has the latest changes from the `alexa-skill-handler-service` repository.

    git fetch upstream
